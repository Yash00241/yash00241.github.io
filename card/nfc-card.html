                    <p>I designed and built an NFC Business Card, which allows for easy sharing of contact information through a simple tap on a smartphone. It would contain the link if this website. And all my projects could be seen there I have shipped it I am so excited to see it in my hands. Thanks a lot to Hackclub once again for doing such great projects for us like students :D</p>
